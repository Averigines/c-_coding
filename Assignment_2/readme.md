    Solving the Tower of Hanoi Problem


## About The Project

This is an implementation of a recursive and iterative way to solve the Tower of Hanoi in the optimal number of steps.


### Built With

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [.NET 6](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/)


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Installed IDE
* INstalled .NET 6 or higher


### Installation

1. Extract the zip file.
2. Open the folder in IDE of your choice.
3. Open a terminal inside your IDE.
4. Type this in the terminal to build the project: ``dotnet build ``


## Usage

To get the solution, type the following in the console:

``dotnet hanoi -Iterative n"``
or
``dotnet hanoi -Recursive n"``
with n being the number of disks you want.

The solution will be output in the console in ASCII-Art style for iterative and normal text for recursive.


## Roadmap

- [x] Tower of Hanoi Iterative
- [x] Tower of Hanoi Recursive
- [x] Outputting ASCII-Art
