## About The Project

This is the Refactor of the first assignment of the C# class. I added use of Genereics to both Sorting algorithms to be able to sort Strings aswell.


### Built With

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [.NET 6](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/)


## Getting Started

* INstalled .NET 6 or higher


### Installation

1. Extract the zip file.
2. Open the folder in IDE of your choice.
3. Open a terminal inside your IDE.
4. Type this in the terminal to build the project: ``dotnet build ``


## Usage

To get sorted arrays, insert this syntax in the terminal:

For Bubble-Sort:
``dotnet sort -Bubble -int "3,1,4,2"``
or
``dotnet sort -Bubble -string "apple,banana,grapefruit,coconut"``

For Merge-Sort:
``dotnet sort -Merge -int "3,1,4,2"``
or
``dotnet sort -Merge -string "apple,banana,grapefruit,coconut"``

The sorted array will be output in the console.


## Roadmap
